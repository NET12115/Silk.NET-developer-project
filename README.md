Silk.NET is a high-speed, advanced library, providing bindings to popular low-level APIs such as OpenGL and OpenAL. Use Silk.NET to add cross-platform 3D graphics, audio, compute and haptics to your C# application.

Silk.NET works on any .NET Standard 2.0 compliant platform. This includes Xamarin, .NET Framework 4.6.1+, and .NET Core 2.0+.

# Features
- **Performance**: We use lesser-known techniques for our native interop which makes our bindings blazing fast.
- **Up-to-date**: We've built Silk.NET around the latest versions of the Khronos specifications. This means that Silk.NET includes OpenGL 4.6 (and its **NVIDIA ray-tracing** extensions), OpenGLES 3.2.
- **High-level utilities**: We provide high-level abstractions around Windowing and Input APIs, which means your apps can run on any platform without changing a single line.
- **Game-ready**: Making games or game engines with Silk.NET is a breeze as you already have everything a game needs - Graphics, Audio, Input, and Windowing; all in one product!

# The team
We currently have the following maintainers:
- [Dylan P.](https://github.com/Perksey) from [Ultz](https://github.com/Ultz)
- [Kai J.](https://github.com/HurricanKai) from the open-source community

As well as some helpers from the community:
- [Vivian J.](https://github.com/devvoid) - a community member who basically wrote half the library.
- [Maximiliano L.](https://github.com/maxilevi) - developer of [Project Hedra](https://projecthedra.com/) using Silk.NET.
- [Aaron P.](https://github.com/AzyIsCool) - director at [Ultz](https://github.com/Ultz).
- [Frederik A.](https://github.com/frederikja163) - imparting knowledge on those using Silk.NET.
- [Robert S.](https://github.com/Pyrdacor) - developer of [freeserf.net](https://github.com/Pyrdacor/freeserf.net) and lead developer of [Silk UI](https://github.com/Ultz/SilkUI)

# Building from source

- Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed
- Clone the repository
- Run `generator.bat` or `generator.sh` (to generate the bindings)
- Run `dotnet build`

# Documentation

Nothing here yet, but don't worry - we're working on it.

Several examples can be found in the `examples` folder.

You can find the Lab in the `src/Lab` folder. While many of these projects demonstrate functionality of Silk, these are intended more as experiments and tests for the library itself, and often demonstrate bad programming practices. Use with caution!
