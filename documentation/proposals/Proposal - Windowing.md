- [x] Approved
- [x] Implemented

# Design Decisions
- I was dissatisfied with the windowing system I worked on, primarily because I felt it was too large and bloated. It suffered from attempting to recreate an older API, instead of being a true new beginning. With this proposal, I hope to create a new API that feels familiar, but is much cleaner and easier to work with.

- Our current mathematics library, `System.Numerics`, does not provide support for a few important types, most notably integer vectors. For now, Points and Sizes are used instead.

# Proposed API

## Interfaces

- The main interface is `IWindow`, an interface representing a window. It contains very little of its own, and mostly serves to implement the other `IWindow*` interfaces for the sake of convenience.

- A few properties are implemented here instead of `IWindowProperties`; this is to avoid forcing `WindowOptions` to implement them as well, since they aren't needed in that context.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Base interface for a window.
/// </summary>
public interface IWindow : IWindowProperties, IWindowFunctions, IWindowEvents
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A handle to the underlying window.
    /// </summary>
    IntPtr Handle { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// If true, the window has failed to reach the target framerate for multiple consecutive frames,
    /// as defined in <see cref="IWindowProperties.RunningSlowTolerance"/>. You can use this to
    /// do things such as lowering visual fidelity to increase framerates on lower-end machines.
    /// </summary>
    bool IsRunningSlowly { get; }
}
```

- The first interface is `IWindowProperties`.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Contains all window properties.
/// </summary>
public interface IWindowProperties
{
    /// <summary>
    /// If true, both updates and rendering will happen on the same thread. If false, both updating
    /// and rendering will be run on their own threads. Default is true.
    /// </summary>
    bool UseSingleThreadedWindow { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The position of the window. Integer vector. If set to -1, use the backend default.
    /// Default is -1 for both components.
    /// </summary>
    Point Position { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The size of the window. Integer vector. Default is 1280 x 720.
    /// </summary>
    Size Size { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The number of rendering operations to run per second. If 0, the framerate will be uncapped.
    /// Default is 0.
    /// </summary>
    double FramesPerSecond { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The number of update operations to run per second. If 0, the update rate will be uncapped.
    /// Default is 0.
    /// </summary>
    double UpdatesPerSecond { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The graphics API to use, and associated configurations.
    /// Default is OpenGL 3.3 forward-compatable core profile.
    /// </summary>
    GraphicsAPI API { get; }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// The title of the window. Default is "Silk.NET Window".
    /// </summary>
    string Title { get; set; }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// The state of the window. Default is Normal.
    /// </summary>
    WindowState WindowState { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The type of border the window has. Default is Resizable.
    /// </summary>
    WindowBorder WindowBorder { get; set; }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// The vertical synchronization mode to use. Default is On.
    /// </summary>
    VSyncMode VSync { get; set; }
	
    /// <summary>
    /// The number of frames the window needs to be running slowly for before
    /// <see cref="IWindow.IsRunningSlowly"/> is set to true. Default is 5.
    /// </summary>
    int RunningSlowTolerance { get; set; }
}
```

- Next is `IWindowFunctions`. This is very standard for windows, since most functionality will be provided by users via callbacks.

- Certain backends (such as GLFW) have limits as to what functions can be called on threads that the windowing system wasn't initialized. In these cases, [Ultz.Dispatcher](https://github.com/Ultz/Dispatcher) should be used as a workaround for multithreading. The `Invoke` methods provide user-access to the main UI thread.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Contains all windowing functions.
/// </summary>
public interface IWindowFunctions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Closes this window.
    /// </summary>
    void Close();

    /// <summary>
    /// Processes pending window events.
    /// </summary>
    void ProcessEvents();

    /// <summary>
    /// Makes the GraphicsContext current on the calling thread.
    /// </summary>
    void MakeCurrent();

    /// <summary>
    /// Transforms the specified point from screen to client coordinates.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="point">
    /// The <see cref="Point" /> to transform.
    /// </param>
    /// <returns>
    /// The point transformed to client coordinates.
    /// </returns>
    Point PointToClient(Point point);

    /// <summary>
    /// Transforms the specified point from client to screen coordinates.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="point">
    /// The <see cref="Point" /> to transform.
    /// </param>
    /// <returns>
    /// The point transformed to screen coordinates.
    /// </returns>
    Point PointToScreen(Point point);

    /// <summary>
    /// Invokes this delegate on the window's main thread.
    /// </summary>
    object Invoke(Delegate d);

    /// <summary>
    /// Invokes this delegate on the window's main thread, with the provided arguments.
    /// </summary>
    object Invoke(Delegate d, params object[] args);
}
```

- Next is `IWindowEvents`. Several events GLFW provides have been omitted. Everything related to input has been removed, as it would be redundant to have input-handling both here and in `Silk.NET.Input`. In addition, certain events (such as `WindowBorderChanged`) have been omitted, as those variables will only ever be updated when the user updates them manually.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Contains all window virtual functions.
/// </summary>
public interface IWindowEvents
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the window is moved.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<Point> OnMove;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the window is resized.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<Size> OnResize;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the window is about to close.
    /// </summary>
    event Action OnClosing;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the window state is changed.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<WindowState> OnStateChanged;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the window focus changes.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<bool> OnFocusChanged;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the user drops files onto the window.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<string[]> OnFileDrop;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when the window first begins to run.
    /// </summary>
    event Action OnLoad;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when an update should be run.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<double> OnUpdate;

    /// <summary>
    /// Raised when a frame should be rendered.
    /// </summary>
    event Action<double> OnRender;
}
```

- The GLFW or Native platforms can't be referenced by the main windowing package. This means that we need to work out our own cross-platform windowing platform management API.

- To do so, we add `ISilkPlatform`. Every windowing platform package must include, at minimum, two classes: An implementation of `IWindow`, and an implementation of `ISilkPlatform`.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// An interface that provides windowing for its respective .NET platform.
/// </summary>
public interface ISilkPlatform
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets a value indicating whether this <see cref="ISilkPlatform"> should be used, based on the
    /// current runtime/environment.
    /// </summary>
    bool IsApplicable { get; }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a window with the given options.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="opts">The initial settings this window should open with.</param>
    /// <returns>An implementation of <see cref="IWindow"/></returns>
    IWindow GetWindow(WindowOptions opts);
}
```

## Classes

- To easily get the proper `ISilkPlatform` for the current configuration, we add a new static class, `Silk`, which will automatically select an applicable platform.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Provides methods and properties for configuring Silk.NET's Windowing system. In most cases, the end
/// user shouldn't use this class.
/// </summary>
public static Silk
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the current windowing platform.
    /// </summary>
    public static ISilkPlatform CurrentPlatform { get; set; }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Searches for references to official Silk.NET platforms, and picks the first applicable one for this environment.
    /// applicable one.
    /// </summary>
    /// <exception cref="NotSupportedException">
    /// Thrown if no applicable <see cref="ISilkPlatform" /> was found.
    /// </exception>
    public static void Init();
}
```

- To further simplify the process for end users, we add one more new static class, `Window`, which will wrap the process of getting the proper platform and getting a window from it.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Convenience wrapper for easily creating a Silk.NET window.
/// </summary>
public static class Window
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Create a window on the current platform.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="options">The window to use.</param>
    /// <returns>A Silk.NET window using the current platform.</returns>
    public static IWindow Create(WindowOptions options);
}
```

- We have our `GlfwWindow` class. For the purposes of compatability with other backends, there should be as few extra properties that aren't in `IWindow` as possible.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// A Slim.NET window using the GLFW backend
/// </summary>
public class GlfwWindow : IWindow
{
	/// <summary>
        /// Create and open a new GlfwWindow.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="options">The options to use for this window.</param>
	public GlfwWindow(WindowOptions options);
}
```

## Structs

- To avoid having an excessive number of constructors, and to allow for multiple defaults for multiple situations, we initialize objects Vulkan-style; we fill out a struct with all the properties, and pass that to the constructor.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Contains all window properties, used for window creation.
/// </summary>
public struct WindowOptions : IWindowProperties
{
    // Contains everything from IWindowProperties,
    // but with setters for all functions that don't have them.

    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a new WindowOptions struct, with sensible defaults.
    /// </summary>
    public WindowOptions(/*all properties from IWindowProperties*/);

    /// <summary>
    /// Convinience wrapper around creating a new WindowProperties with the default values.
    /// </summary>
    public static WindowOptions Default => new WindowOptions(/*sensible defaults*/);
}
```

- All variables related to the graphics API are contained in the `GraphicsAPI` struct:

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents a configuration for a graphics API.
/// </summary>
public struct GraphicsAPI
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The render API to use.
    /// </summary>
    public ContextAPI API { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The profile to use.
    /// </summary>
    public ContextProfile Profile { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Context creation flags.
    /// </summary>
    public ContextFlags Flags { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The version of the API to use.
    /// </summary>
    public APIVersion Version { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a new GraphicsAPI struct.
    /// </summary>
    public GraphicsAPI(api, profile, flags, version);

    /// <summary>
    /// The default graphics API. This is OpenGL 3.3 core profile, with forward
    /// compatability enabled.
    /// </summary>
    public static GraphicsAPI Default => new GraphicsAPI(ContextAPI.OpenGL,
        ContextProfile.Core, ContextFlags.ForwardCompatible, new APIVersion(3, 3));
}
```

- Since `System.Version` includes more integers than is necessary for our purposes, a new `APIVersion` struct was created instead:

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents the desired version of an API.
/// </summary>
public struct APIVersion
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The major version of the API.
    /// </summary>
    public int MajorVersion;

    /// <summary>
    /// The minor version of the API.
    /// </summary>
    public int MinorVersion;

    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a new APIVersion from two integers.
    /// </summary>
    public APIVersion(int majorVersion, int minorVersion);

    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a new APIVersion from a <see cref="System.Version"/>
    /// </summary>
    public APIVersion(Version version);
}
```

## Enums

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents which API the graphics context should use.
/// </summary>
public enum ContextAPI
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Don't use any API. This is necessary for linking an external API, such as Vulkan, to the window.
    /// </summary>
    None = 0,

    /// <summary>
    /// Use Vulkan. Silk.NET doesn't support this yet.
    /// </summary>
    Vulkan,

    /// <summary>
    /// Use core OpenGL. This is standard for software intended for desktop computers.
    /// </summary>
    OpenGL,

    /// <summary>
    /// Use OpenGL ES. This is standard for software intended to be compatable with embedded systems,
    /// such as phones.
    /// </summary>
    OpenGLES
}
```

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents flags related to the OpenGL context.
/// </summary>
[Flags]
public enum ContextFlags
{
    /// <summary>
    /// No flags enabled.
    /// </summary>
    Default = 0,

    /// <summary>
    /// Enables debug context; debug contexts provide more debugging info, but can run slower.
    /// </summary>
    Debug = 1,

    /// <summary>
    /// Enables forward compatability; this context won't support anything marked as deprecated
    /// in the current
    /// version.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>On OpenGL contexts older than 3.0, this flag does nothing.</remarks>
    ForwardCompatible = 2
}
```

- Despite GLFW supporting a "don't care" option for the profile, we decided not to include it in the surface API; allowing the backend to choose the profile could introduce platform inconsistencies.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents the context profile OpenGL should use.
/// </summary>
public enum ContextProfile
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Uses a core OpenGL context, which removes some deprecated functionality.
    /// </summary>
    Core = 0,

    /// <summary>
    /// Uses a compatability OpenGL context, allowing for some deprecated functionality. This should
    /// only ever be used for maintaining legacy code; no newly-written software should use this.
    /// </summary>
    Compatability
}
```

```cs
/// <summary>
/// The vertical synchronization mode to use.
/// </summary>
public enum VSyncMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// VSync is disabled.
    /// </summary>
    Off = 0,
        
    /// <summary>
    /// VSync is enabled.
    /// </summary>
    On,

    /// <summary>
    /// Use adaptive VSync. If the window IsRunningSlowly, VSync will be disabled. Otherwise,
    /// it will be enabled. If the framerate is uncapped, this is the same as <see cref="On"/>. 
    /// </summary>
    Adaptive,
}
```

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents the window border.
/// </summary>
public enum WindowBorder
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The window can be resized by clicking and dragging its border.
    /// </summary>
    Resizable = 0,

    /// <summary>
    /// The window border is visible, but cannot be resized. All window-resizings must happen
    /// solely in the code.
    /// </summary>
    Fixed,

    /// <summary>
    /// The window border is hidden.
    /// </summary>
    Hidden
}
```

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents the current state of the window.
/// </summary>
public enum WindowState
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The window is in its regular configuration.
    /// </summary>
    Normal = 0,

    /// <summary>
    /// The window has been minimized to the task bar.
    /// </summary>
    Minimized,

    /// <summary>
    /// The window has been maximized, covering the entire desktop, but not the taskbar.
    /// </summary>
    Maximized,

    /// <summary>
    /// The window has been fullscreened, covering the entire surface of the monitor.
    /// </summary>
    Fullscreen
}
```
