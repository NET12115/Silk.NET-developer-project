            - Fixed a bug where calling an unloaded OpenGL function will throw a GlfwException.
            - Fixed a bug where GLFW wasn't swapping the buffers (no drawing will ever make it to the window!)
            - Refactored Silk.NET.Core, unifying the platform loading logic.
            - Renamed OnRender to Render + other windowing events
            - Added mobile support.
