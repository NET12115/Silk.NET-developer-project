        <PackageReleaseNotes>
            Silk.NET February 2021 Update
            
            - Add native handles for Windowing
            - Add Veldrid support
            - Add support for macro constants
            - Add support for unnamed nested anonymous struct fields
            - Add better name hinting for anonymous types
            - Add support for OpenGL token reuse for tokens that had been previously deprecated & removed, fixing #400 
            - Add nested anonymous struct "fusion" with their parent structs, allowing direct ref access on .NET Standard 2.1 platforms without going through the anonymous field
            - Add static Guid members for structs with a COM interface ID
            - Fix struct field size & type variation between 32-bit and 64-bit in generated C++ bindings
            - Fix calling convention detection, and actually respect the calling convention we detect
            - Fix being unable to specify calling convention using NativeApiAttribute
            - Fix some type issues
            - Fix accidental initialization of both platforms, resolving #407
            - Fix zero-length string allocation resulting in an IndexOutOfRangeException exception by clamping the allocation length to 1, resolving #396
            - Fix unreasonably small delta times when running a window with OpenGL V-Sync enabled
            - Fix faulty addition in Silk.NET.Maths where (u)ints were produced by (s)byte and (u)short addition, resulting in an invalid cast
            - Fix malformed XML in MSBuild targets included by Silk.NET.Windowing.Sdl.Android, resolving #405

            This should be treated as an "emergency patch" and you should update as soon as reasonably practicable. Some of the bugs in 2.0 are fatal in some workloads.
