            - Add ExtensionName constants to all extension classes (useful for Vulkan)
            - Add an option for waiting for events before proceeding to execute the render loop.

            - Fix a bug where eventhough we fixed the previous VSync bug, we still weren't respecting initial vsync settings.
            - Fix a bug where directly accessing scroll-wheel info would return bogus data
            - Fix a bug where Render and Update are fired again after close
            - Deprecated adaptive vsync
            - Deprecated SilkManager
            - Deprecated obsolete native methods that we weren't annotating as obsolete before
